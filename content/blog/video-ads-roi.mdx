In the world of paid social, **creative is the new targeting**. Facebook's algorithm is smart enough to find your audience, but it needs good content to keep them engaged.

## Why Video Wins

1.  **Stop the Scroll:** Motion catches the eye.
2.  **Storytelling:** You can convey emotion and value in seconds.
3.  **Trust:** Seeing real people and real results builds credibility.

## The "Ugly" vs. Professional Debate

User Generated Content (UGC) has its place, but for high-ticket services (real estate, extensive renovations, luxury goods), professional video establishes premium positioning.

## Investing in Assets

A professional brand video isn't an expense; it's an asset. You can slice it into reels, use it on your website, and run it as an ad for months.
