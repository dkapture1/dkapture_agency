If you run a home service business in Florida—whether it's HVAC, landscaping, pool cleaning, or remodeling—Google Ads is your most powerful weapon. But it's also the easiest way to burn money if done wrong.

## Why Florida is Different

The competition in cities like Miami, Orlando, and Tampa is fierce. CPC (Cost Per Click) can be high.

  **Don't DIY:** Setting up a campaign without negative keywords is the #1 reason small businesses fail with Google Ads.

## The "Near Me" Strategy

Your customers are searching for "pool cleaning near me" or "emergency plumber Miami". You need to dominate these local intent keywords.

### Budget Recommendations

For a small remodeling business, we typically recommend starting with a budget of at least $1,500/month to see significant results.

## Tracking Conversions

It's not about clicks; it's about **calls**. Ensure your campaigns are tracking phone calls as primary conversions.
