Time is your most valuable asset. If you are still manually copying data from emails to spreadsheets, you are losing money.

## 1. Automated Lead Capture

Connect your Facebook Lead Forms directly to your CRM using Zapier or Make. Call them within 5 minutes.

<StatCard value="21x" label="Conversion Likelihood" description="When leads are contacted within 5 minutes." />

## 2. Review Requests

Set up an automation that sends a text message asking for a Google Review exactly 1 hour after a job is marked "Complete".

## 3. Social Media Repurposing

Use AI to turn one YouTube video into 5 TikTok clips, a blog post, and a newsletter.

## 4. Invoice Chasing

Stop having awkward conversations. Let an automated email sequence remind clients about unpaid invoices.

## 5. FAQ Chatbot

Install an AI chatbot on your site to answer "What are your hours?" and "Do you serve my area?" instantly, 24/7.
